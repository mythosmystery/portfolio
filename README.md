##My work
I used materialize CSS and a little jQuery to build my portfolio. I added all of the new projects and assignments I have completed since the first portfolio.

## Updated Portfolio

üíÅ Need help updating your Portfolio? Check out the [Career Services milestone resources for online presence](https://mycareerspot.org/onlinepresence).

Your updated portfolio should:

1. Display your full name, email, and phone number

2. Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile

3. Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume

4. Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following:

    * Project title

    * Link to the deployed version

    * Link to the GitHub repository

    * Screenshot of the deployed application

5. Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.

### Design

Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
  the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
