                        <p>
                           My name is Hunter Barton and I am a 23 year old software developer, photographer and
                           musician. In 2020 I moved to Oklahoma City from Tucson, AZ. My first passion is music. When I
                           was 10 years old I got a bass guitar for christmas and I've been hooked ever since. I have
                           been playing bass, and now other instruments like guitar and piano for the last 13 years. I
                           have been in several bands. I took a photography class in highschool and that got me
                           interested in photography. About 4 years ago I got my first real camera and started taking
                           pictures of everything I could see. Not long after that I started recording video too. I have
                           filmed several concerts and would like to do more once live music is back. I have been
                           programming for about 5 years, but I have had an interest since a young age because of my Dad
                           who is also a programmer. I started with Java and have moved on to learning the MERN stack.
                           My passion for programming and computers has always drawn me to the industry. I especially
                           would like to merge all of my interests and do work on coding projects related to music or
                           photo/video. I have taken programming classes at Pima Community College in Tucson, AZ. I am
                           currently working through the programming bootcamp at GA Tech. As well as a passion for
                           software I also have a passion for electronics. I worked as an audio electronics technician
                           for nearly 5 years. I have very diverse interests and skills, and I would like to merge them
                           all together to become a truly full stack developer and person.
